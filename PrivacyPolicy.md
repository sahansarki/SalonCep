## Third Party Access

The Application utilizes third-party services for specific functionality. These services have their own Privacy Policies about handling data:

* **[RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)** - Used for subscription management and payment processing

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

* As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
* When they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request

## Data Retention Policy

The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you maintain an active account with the Application.

## Security

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Your data is stored on Google Firebase's infrastructure, which provides its own security measures.

The Service Provider relies on Firebase's built-in security features to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While Firebase provides infrastructure security, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your personal information.

We recommend that you:
* Use a strong, unique password for your account
* Do not share your login credentials with others
* Log out of your account when using shared devices


## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

**This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-10-26**
